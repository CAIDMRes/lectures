In part this will highlight the difficulties of expert rule-based AI even for such a trivial task.\n","\n","## Restarting your Virtual Machine\n","\n","If at any point during this assignment you accidentally execute code or do something that cannot seem to undo and need to \"restart\" the system (including deleting all temporary folders), go ahead and run the following single line of code. It will take about 1 minute to restart. Following this, you will have to proceed at the beginning of the assignment to re-downloaded the data and run the code you have written.
